# Well-logging-data-for-reservoir-analysis

Here, two sets of well-logging data for partial sampling points from two wells are provided, including sampling depth (m), P-wave velocity (m/s), S-wave velocity (m/s), density (g/cmÂ³), sand content, shale content, porosity, and gas saturation.

Since well logging interpretation data contains abundant reservoir information, it can be used to understand reservoir rock characteristics and provide a data foundation for both forward modeling ands inversion of wavefields.
