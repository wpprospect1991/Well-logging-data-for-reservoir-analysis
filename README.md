# Well-logging-data-for-reservoir-analysis

Here, two sets of well-logging data for partial sampling points from two wells (Well A and Well B) in China are provided, including sampling depth (m), P-wave velocity (Vp, m/s), S-wave velocity (Vs, m/s), density (Den, g/cmÂ³), sand content, shale content, porosity (Por), and gas saturation (Sg).

Since well logging interpretation data contains abundant reservoir information, it can be used to understand reservoir rock characteristics and provide a data foundation for both forward modeling and inversion.

The well-logging curves are shown below:
